Description: Provides helper functions for use of hash-based matching (HBM)
    for pseudo-random number generation (PRNG) in stochastic simulations.
    HBM-PRNG is an approach to simplify matching synthetic experiment samples,
    which ensures that matched runs different only in the focal parameters, not
    in their chance events.
